DSA Algorithm Visualization Website


Description: Developed an interactive website to visualize various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), enhancing users' understanding of algorithm functionality through visual representation.
Technologies Used: React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
Key Contributions:
Implemented visualization tools for a variety of sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.
Developed visualizations for searching algorithms such as Linear Search, Binary Search, and Jump Search.
Created interactive representations for recursive algorithms like Tower of Hanoi and N-Queens Problem.
Designed maze generation algorithms including DFS Maze, Kruskal Maze, Recursive Division, and Binary Tree Maze.
Enhanced user experience by providing real-time feedback and detailed step-by-step algorithm animations.
Ensured the platform is intuitive and educational, serving as a valuable resource for students and educators alike.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
